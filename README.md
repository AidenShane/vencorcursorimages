# vencorcursorimages

This repo serves as a place for Discord users who use vencord to get cursor images.

BetterDiscord / other client modifications may use this, but Vencord specific cursor images may not work.

Most of these cursors will be .cur images.

The number at the end (icon#-mouse-cursor-##.cur) represent the size (#x#), which represents your scaling on your display settings.

At 100% scaling: 32x32 pixel bounding box
At 150% scaling: 48x48 pixel bounding box
At 200% scaling: 64x64 pixel bounding box


!! CLIENT MODIFICATIONS BREAK DISCORD'S TERMS OF SERVICE, HOWEVER NO BANS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!
