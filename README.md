# vencorcursorimages

This repo serves as a place for Discord users who use vencord to get cursor images.

BetterDiscord / other client modifications may use this, but Vencord specific cursor images may not work.

Most of these cursors will be .cur images.

The number at the end (icon#-mouse-cursor-##.cur) represent the size (#x#), which represents your scaling on your display settings.

At 100% scaling = 32x32 pixel bounding box
At 150% scaling = 48x48 pixel bounding box
At 200% scaling = 64x64 pixel bounding box

Credits to icons8.com for the png files.
Credits to convertio.co for the .png to .cur conversions.


!! CLIENT MODIFICATIONS BREAK DISCORD'S TERMS OF SERVICE, HOWEVER NO BANS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!
